# Reddit Bot for Yu-Gi-Oh cards 

Implemented in Python 3.9 using PRAW 7.5

## Features

Works on submission bodies as well as comments

Matches card names as long as the user input is "close enough" using difflib's get_close_matches function (E.G. {bllue eye wheat dragoon} will output Blue-Eyes White Dragon)

Handles special characters which are required to fetch certain cards (E.G. {evil twin lilla} will output Evilâ˜…Twin_Lil-la)

Matches card names if they are a substring of the full card name (E.G. {garnet} will output Gem-Knight Garnet)

{CARDNAME} outputs links containing an image of the card as well as its wiki article, price data and Master Duel entry

{{CARDNAME}} outputs all of the above as well as full information about the card in text
