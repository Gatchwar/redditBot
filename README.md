# Reddit Bot for Yu-Gi-Oh cards 

A Reddit bot that replies to comments and submissions which include the names of Yugioh cards enclosed by curly brackets. Implemented in Python 3.9 using PRAW 7.5

## Features

Works on submission bodies as well as comments

Matches card names as long as the user input is "close enough" using difflib's get_close_matches function (E.G. {bllue eye wheat dragoon} will output Blue-Eyes White Dragon)

Handles special characters which are required to fetch certain cards (E.G. {evil twin lilla} will output Evilâ˜…Twin Lil-la)

Matches card names if input is a substring of the full card name (E.G. {garnet} will output Gem-Knight Garnet)

{CARDNAME} outputs links containing an image of the card as well as its wiki article, price data and Master Duel entry

{{CARDNAME}} outputs all of the above as well as full information about the card in text

Does not use external database or text file to store card names or comments

Can be run on a Heroku Dyno using included Procfile and starter.sh bash script
